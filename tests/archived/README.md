# Archived Test Files

This folder contains test artifacts and supplementary files that are not needed for regular test execution.

## Contents

- **screenshots/** - Test failure screenshots (auto-generated by Cypress)
- **videos/** - Test execution videos (auto-generated by Cypress)
- **downloads/** - Files downloaded during test execution
- **performance/** - Performance and load testing scripts
- **QUICK_REFERENCE.md** - Quick reference documentation (duplicated in main docs)

## Notes

These files are automatically regenerated during test runs and don't need to be version controlled. The archived folder helps keep the main test directory clean and focused on test specs and configuration.
